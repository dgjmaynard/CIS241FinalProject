			<p>I enjoy baking so I started my own home-based bakery business, <a href="https://www.forevermooresweets.com"><strong>Forever Moore Sweets</strong></a>.  I specialize in cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and decorated cookies.  Running a business is teaching me a lot.  My dream is to someday have a food truck and a brick & mortar building that I own.

			<div><h2 style="text-align:center;"><a id="church">Trinity Everett</a></h2>
			<p>I am also active in my church, <a href="https://www.trinityeverett.org/"><strong>Trinity Episcopal</strong></a> in Everett,  where I am involved with many groups, activities and fundraisers.  During this time of COVID-19, I have not been able to attend church physically but I stay in contact with many of my church family members via social media and Zoom.

			<p>As part of my business, I have been learning to use a 3D printer to create my own cookie cutters.  I have quite the cookie cutter collection already but I love the process of learning new technologies and putting them to good use. I use <a href="https://cookiecad.com/"><strong>CookieCad</strong></a> where I can upload my design and it produces a cookie cutter file that I can upload to my 3D printer.

			<p>Since I love coffee so much, I am learning to roast my own coffee beans.  I also think it would be a great addition to my bakery.  What goes better with baked goods than coffee?  <a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com/"><strong>Sweet Maria's</strong></a> has many of the supplies, and tutorials that I need to be able to roast from home.  They have quite the selection of green coffee beans ready to be roasted.  I am learning quite a bit about the roasting process and I love to drink my custom roasted coffee.
