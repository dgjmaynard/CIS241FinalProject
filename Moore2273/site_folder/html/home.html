			Hello!! My name is <strong>Deborah Moore</strong> and I live in Everett with my husband.  As you can see, my favorite color is purple and I like to use it wherever I can.  Seeing the color purple makes me happy.  When you see me in public, you will recognize me because I am often wearing something purple.  I have been a student at <a href="https://www.edmonds.edu/"><strong>Edmonds College</strong></a> since 2018 where I have been enrolled in both Computer Science and Computer Information Systems Programs.
			</p>
			<p class="margin" style="font-size:20px;">
			At <a href="https://www.edmonds.edu/"><strong>Edmonds College</strong></a>, I am working on adding training to my current engineering degree in hopes of finding a new job.  I believe that education is important and we should never stop learning.  I also believe that we should immerse ourselves in the things we love to do.

			I enjoy baking so I started my own home-based bakery business, <a href="https://www.forevermooresweets.com"><strong>Forever Moore Sweets</strong></a> .  I specialize in cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and decorated cookies.  Running a business is teaching me a lot.  My dream is to someday have a food truck and a brick & mortar building that I own.
			</p>
			<p class="margin" style="font-size:20px;">
			As part of my business, I have been learning to use a 3D printer to create my own cookie cutters.  I have quite the cookie cutter collection already but I love the process of learning new technologies and putting them to good use.
			Also, since I love coffee so much, I am learning to roast my own coffee beans.

			I am also active in my church <a href="https://www.trinityeverett.org/"><strong>Trinity Episcopal</strong></a> in Everett,  where I am involved with many groups, activities and fundraisers.  During this time of COVID-19, I have not been able to attend church physically but I stay in contact with many of my church family members.
