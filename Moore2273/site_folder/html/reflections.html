		<h2 style="color:purple; text-align:center; margin-top:0px;" >My Thoughts on CIS241 - Web Development I</h2>
		<br>
		<p class="margin" style="font-size:20px;">
		I am glad that I decided to register for <strong>CIS241 - Web Development I</strong>. At first, I was intimidated with the thought of being able to develop and create a website but this class was able to provide a step-by-step approach to website development using HTML5 and CSS3.  Even though I have created my own business website with the use of Wix, a GUI editor and have a technical background, I still expected to have a harder time with the class.
		</p>

		<p class="margin" style="font-size:20px;">
		I have definitely learned more from making seemingly big mistakes only to figure out where I messed up and then correct the error.  I know that when I make a mistake, as I have done SEVERAL times during the development of this project, I am somewhat confident that I will figure out a way to fix it and in some cases make it better.
		</p>

		<p class="margin" style="font-size:20px;">
		I am looking forward to taking <strong>CIS242 - Web Development II</strong> and learning more.
